# Polynomial-Regression
Polynomial Regression is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent(y) and independent variable(x) as nth degree polynomial. 

Equation of the Polynomial Regression Model:
Simple Linear Regression equation:         y = b0+b1x         .........(a)

Multiple Linear Regression equation:         y= b0+b1x+ b2x2+ b3x3+....+ bnxn         .........(b)

Polynomial Regression equation:         y= b0+b1x + b2x2+ b3x3+....+ bnxn         ..........(c)
